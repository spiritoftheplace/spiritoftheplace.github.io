        <h2>Spirit of the Place</h2>
        <p>
            Spirit of the Place is an experiment in unlocking a new level of interaction and expression in local communities. We believe people who share their love for a place should have a tool to express their relationship to that place, and to build a stronger community around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine that every place&mdash;a street, a building, a local square&mdash;has its own unique Spirit, a ghost inhabiting the local area. Whenever you're around, you can talk to it, share a thought or story related to the area, ask for information.

        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>
            We envision humans interacting with Spirits through a variety of channels&mdash;for example, augmented reality (AR) technology on your phone, or a pair of AR glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
            In AR, each place inhabited by a Spirit will be marked by a simple, symbolic pole which appears when you point your device at a specified location.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Spirit is a representation of the whole community: its preferences, its values, its quirks.
            As such, members of the community can directly influence the Spirit's appearance and behavior over time. Gradually, the evolving diversity of the Spirits will grow to reflect the diversity of the places that our cities are made of.
