        <p>
            Spirit of the Place is an experimental project which aims to unlock a new level of local communication and expression for people who love and inhabit the same places.

            Spirits are like ghosts inhabiting places - buildings, streets, trees - but you can talk
            to them, ask them for recent local news, share a story. A Spirit can be interacted with
            by anyone who is in the place where the Spirit lives.

        <p>
            We are starting with creating the first Spirit in Dalston, London. Local residents will
            be able to interact with the Spirit using augmented reality (AR) technology on their phones.
